# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release line on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security reports.

Send a private report with:

- vulnerability type
- affected component/file
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- suggested remediation (if available)

Use GitHub Security Advisories for private disclosure:

- https://github.com/ychampion/codeclaw/security/advisories/new

If advisories are unavailable for your account context, open a private support request and clearly mark it as a security report.

## Response Expectations

- Initial triage acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Risk assessment + mitigation plan: as soon as reproducible
- Public disclosure: after patch is available and users can upgrade
